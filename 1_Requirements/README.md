# **Wiper Control System**

## **Introduction**

In cars, a wiper control system replaces the standard wiper blade with an electrical component. In this setup, the ignition button (on the motor) will be controlled by a single switch in the ACC position. Switch on the wiper system with a second press, then vary the wiper speed with a third press, and finally turn off the motor with a fourth press. All of this was done with the help of LEDs and a simulation tool.A wiper is a vital component that removes rainfall or any other liquid from the windscreen of a vehicle. The previous method required manual wiper activation, and raising the wiper was a tough task. As a result, this system is being presented as a solution to these problems. The project's goals are to supply wiping systems for older automobiles, improve the system by using actuators and pull switches (using the same switch for various functions by stepwise switching), and manage engine and wiper speed with a single switch. This System regulates the wiper's operation speed in response to the amount of rain. This Wiper Speed Control System is utilised in all sorts of automobiles, and its primary function is to remove rain air drops from the vehicle's front screen.

## **Features**

When the button is pressed ONCE, the automobile will be locked.

When the button is pressed TWICE, the automobile will open.

When the button is pressed THREE times, it will turn on and move clockwise.

When the button is pressed FOUR times, it will wiper off and move in an anticlockwise manner.

When the button is pressed FIVE times, the wiper will complete one cycle.

## **SWOT Analysis**

### **Strength**

Visual clarity.
Operation Silent.
The wiper does not stop in the middle of the window.
We can control the wiper speed using just one button.

### **Weakness**

Increased Replacement Costs
Rubber Blades are required.
Wiper motor problems

### **Opportunities**

Opportunities for safety and good health
Possibilities for Promotion
Increase as a wiper system is required for installation.

### **Threats**

Advance Technology has taken its place.
In the rain, wiper blend could be a problem.


## **4'W & 1'H**

### **Who**

Anyone who wishes to be safe and have clear visibility in bad weather.

### **What**

It is a Wiper Speed Control System programme for all automobiles.

### **Why**

Switching between controls and wipers is simple.

### **When**

In difficult environmental conditions, such as a rainy climate,

### **How**

After wiping the windsheet of motor vehicles, the LED displays the position of the wiper and returns to its normal state.
